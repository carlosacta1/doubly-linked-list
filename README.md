# Challenge
### Doubly Linked lists

A doubly linked list is a data structure consisting of nodes, where each node contains data, a reference to the next node in the sequence, and a reference to the previous node.

**Example:**
```
      head
       |
       v
+------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+      +------+------+
| prev | data |     | prev | data |     | prev | data |     | prev | data |     | prev | data |     | prev | data |      | prev | data |
|  -   |  10  | <---|  10  |  20  | <---|  20  |  30  | <---|  30  |  10  | <---|  10  |  15  | <---|  15  |  20  | <--- |  20  |  20  | <- tail
| next |      |---> | next |      |---> | next |      |---> | next |      |---> | next |      |---> | next |      | ---> | next |      |
|  20  |      |     |  30  |      |     |  10  |      |     |  15  |      |     |  20  |      |     |  20  |      |      |  -   |      |
+------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+     +------+------+      +------+------+
                                                                   ^                                       ^                    ^
                                                            DUPLICATE OF 10                                |- DUPLICATES OF 20 -|
```

Your task is to implement a doubly linked list from scratch, supporting the following operations:
- Insert head
- Insert tail
- Remove an element (By index or value, your choice)
- Remove all duplicate nodes ensuring a single occurrence of each value is kept
- Search for an element, returning it's index if found
- Size of the list

Your code must be implemented to be as performant as possible. Additionally, be sure to include an example that tests your implementation.

# Additional details
- You can resolve the challenge using the programming language of your preference.

- You have 1 hour to complete the challenge.

- After finishing, upload the changes in a Pull Request, assign it to yourself and ensure you request review from any of the invited collaborators to your repository.


**Good luck :)**
